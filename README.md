Dashboard and Report Features

The dashboard acts as a control tower for decision-makers. Here's what you'll find:

    Product Performance Breakdown
    Helps identify top-performing and underperforming products. Includes filters for categories, sub-categories, and product names.

    Customer Insights Section
    Understand who your customers are, where they come from, and how often they return. Includes segmentation between new and returning customers.

    Geographical Sales Map
    Visualizes sales distribution across regions, cities, or countries to spot high- and low-performing areas.

    Time Series Trends
    Weekly and monthly breakdowns highlight seasonal patterns and shifts in sales trends.

    Interactive Filters and Drilldowns
    Slicers allow you to customize views by date, product category, region, or customer type — making it flexible for all stakeholders.
